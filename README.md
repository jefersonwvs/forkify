# forkify

It's a web application to search for recipes.

This project was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Developing this source-code, I could learn the fundamentals of:
- How to consume an API;
- How is developed a front-end web app without third-party libraries and frameworks;
- How to use NPM for managing dependencies;
- How to deploy an app on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Important: I did NOT create the app's HTML and CSS files, instead I only used them when developing the logic (JS files).

_The implementation is based on a [JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) available at Udemy, by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann)._
